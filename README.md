# passenger-entry-record
This is a simple website I made using HTML, CSS and JS. It can be used to update and save a count of people present, entered and exited. This can be used in a heavily crowded place to keep a check on the count of people. It can also be used to ease task of keeping on on walkings, purchases, etc in a commercial business.
